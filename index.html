                field of industry. To run and handle any industry or
                processing plant is not everyone’s cup of tea. Various factors are determined and decided upon to ensure
                that
                the concerned industries are running smoothly and effectively.
                Steam boiler manufacturers provide their efficient and reliable boilers to their clients but are they
                truly as
                efficient as they claim? Why is efficiency an imperative factor in choosing a boiler? And most
                importantly, how
                can we measure and determine the efficiency of the boiler? Read on to know the details to direct your
                decision
                in finding an efficient boiler</p>

            <p class="text-[#102C57] text-[17px] sm:text-[19px] my-[30px]">Steam boilers are an important tool in various industries
                and an unarguable fact is that the initial investment in
                a boiler is a mere fraction of the total annual investment on its fuels. Hence it is prudent to ensure
                that the
                boiler delivers the efficiency as warranted by the steam boiler manufacturer</p>

                <p class="text-[#102C57] text-[17px] sm:text-[19px]">In a nutshell, boiler efficiency is the difference between energy
                    input and energy output that can be calculated
                    and indicated with percentage. The boiler efficiency depends on several factors particularly,
                    Combustion
                    efficiency and Thermal efficiency. It is also termed ‘fuel-to-steam efficiency’ that can assist in
                    assessing the future
                    fuel costs and the estimated lifespan of the boiler.</p>

                <p class="text-[#102C57] text-[17px] sm:text-[19px]">There are several ways to determine steam boiler efficiency.
                    Different methods calculate different factors that
                    eventually lead to boiler efficiency. In calculating boiler efficiency, a ratio varying from the
                    expected ratio
                    indicates the need to modify the operation process or get in touch with the steam boiler
                    manufacturer for their
                    superior knowledge and assistance.

                <p class="text-[#102C57] text-[17px] sm:text-[19px]">Combustion efficiency helps to determine the burner’s capability
                    to burn fuels effectively and assess the
                    unburnt fuel and excess air present in depleting. A boiler is considered efficient if both the

                            It leads to high vapor loss and low efficiency. That is the reason for oil-fired boilers

                        A boiler economizer or flue gas heat recovery unit is a heat
                        exchanger that is installed on the stack of a boiler. It is designed
                        to recover heat that would otherwise be wasted. Economizers can
                        be installed during a new boiler installation or retrofit on an
                        existing system. A boiler is a pressure vessel in which heat from
                        combustion of fuel is used to convert water into steam. The
                        pressurized steam can be utilized for process operations or to
                        power steam engines or steam turbines. The feed water system
                        supplies water for steam generation. Feed water is a mixture of
                        condensate return (steam from the process requirements) and
                        makeup water. The fuel system is made up of the fuel feeding
                        system and the combustion system. The combustion system
                        generates the heat required for combustion. An economizer is a
                        part of the feed water system; it is a heat exchanger used to recover heat from the flue gas. It
                        increases the
                        temperature of water as it enters the steam drum or furnace walls. The economizer is the last
                        water heat
                        transfer unit upstream of the air heater. Economizer is located in the second pass of the
                        boiler.

                        Air Preheaters (APH) are Shell and tube type heat
                        exchangers installed in boilers to heat the air before
                        using it for combustion. The main function of an air
                        preheater is to extract the excess heat from the flue
                        gases in the boiler. As we know, combustion
                        requires air, fuel, and fire to take place. Air
                        preheaters help significantly in feeding the hot air
                        and increasing the combustion efficiency for the
                        operation in steam boilers. For combustion, the fuel
                        fed in boilers is of room temperature that needs
                        heating for ignition, and therefore, hot air is used to
                        enhance the combustion process.

                    Air Preheaters, as mentioned, are actually heat exchangers located at the exit of the flue gas duct
                    in the steam
                    boiler. Air preheaters accelerate the overall thermal efficiency of the boiler by regaining the
                    excess heat in the
                    flue gases that might be lost without the preheaters. With an air preheater, the useful heat is
                    recovered and
                    used for preheating in the combustion process. If the exiting heat is 180°C, air preheaters manage
                    to extract the
                    heat of 100°C for combustion in the boiler.

                        Cyclone boilers are another combustion technology suitable

                        intense radiant heat for slag layer combustion. The burners for

                            Draft fans play an important role in thermal power plants because they
                            regulate the air pressure inside boiler system. Draft fans are broadly
                            divided into two types – Forced Draft (FD Fan) and Induced Draft (ID Fan).
                            Apart from the draft fans, there are also other basic types of process fans
                            used in power plants. They are primary air fans and flue gas recirculation

                            FD fan or forced draft fan, draws air from the atmosphere and forces it
                            into the furnace through a preheater. These fans are located at the inlet
                            of the boiler to push high pressure fresh air into combustion chamber,
                            where it mixes with the fuel to produce positive pressure. The most
                            common centrifugal fans used as FD fans are backward curved and airfoil
                            centrifugal fans. In power plants, where coal is used as fuel for
                            combustion, FD fans are used as secondary air fans to regulate proper
                            combustion and maximize efficiency of the fuel. A typical FD fan
                            arrangement uses inlet and outlet dampers to control and maintain the
                            required air pressure inside the system. These fans have a wheel at the
                            center that is hung on the shaft along with inlet boxes, silencer, filter and

                    Induced draft fan is normally located at the outlet between dust collector and chimney. The fan
                    takes hot flue
                    gases from the boiler through dust collector and delivers it to the chimney into the open
                    atmosphere. ID fan
                    creates negative pressure or suction to discharge the gases out after combustion from the furnace.
                    Since ID fans
                    can handle hot flue gases, they have more corrosion and erosion problems even when used with

                        Gas recirculation fans (FGR) are typically used in power plant
                        boilers to reduce the flue gas pollution content in the gases
                        exhausted from thermal combustion processes. Flue gas re-circulation is a highly effective
                        technique that
                        significantly reduces the Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from burners. Controlling NOx is
                        critical as it the
                        largest contributor to other types of harmful pollutants. NOx emissions are mostly derived from
                        the nitrogen in
                        the combustion air (thermal NOx). These pollutants are produced during combustion process when
                        nitrogen
                        and oxygen react at elevated temperatures. NOx emission levels can be greatly reduced in
                        industrial boilers by
                        recirculating the flue gases from the boiler exhaust duct into the main combustion chamber. Most
                        common

                        A storage tank is a tank designed for storing liquid substances. Although it is mainly used in
                        the petroleum
                        industry (petrol tanks), it can also be used in other industries, for example, it is used in the
                        food industry (oil
                        storage tanks) and the fertilizer industry. A storage container is a container that holds
                        liquids, compressed gases
                        or liquids used for short or long term hot or cold storage. The design and construction of
                        storage tanks are
                        carried out according to international standards. Stored products usually consist of petroleum
                        derivatives or
                        chemicals used in the industry. The most preferred standards for storage tank fabricators are
                        API 650 and API
                        620 standards published by the American Petroleum Institute.

                        In industry, storage tanks operate under little or no pressure, which distinguishes them from
                        pressure vessels.
                        Storage tanks are usually cylindrical in shape, with a flat bottom and fixed breakable or
                        perpendicular to the
                        floor with a floating roof. There are many environmental regulations for the design and
                        operation of storage
                        tanks, which are usually applied depending on the nature of the liquid contained in them.
                        Aboveground storage
                        tanks differ from underground tanks in the applicable regulatory types. Above ground storage
                        tanks can be
                        used to hold materials such as oil, waste, water, chemicals and other hazardous materials.
